      This is Div Tag. It is a type of container. We can group or reside one or
      more than one element inside "div" tag and apply CSS and Javascript over
      all the elements inside this div by just single time effort. We will not
      have to perform the tasks related to CSS and Javascript individually and
      again and again for all the elements. As it is a block level element so is
      any Inline element comes inside the div it will also starts behaving like
      a Block Level Element.
