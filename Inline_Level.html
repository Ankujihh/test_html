      This is Span Tag. It is basically used for editing a single portion from a
      large content. Like, We have a sentence "My name is Ankush Awadhiya.", Now
      I want to apply CSS or JavaScript over word "Ankush", so I will have to
      keep this word inside a span tag. Below is the example of it, I changed
      the color of word "Ankush" from black to blueviolet.</span
    >
    <p>My name is <span id="ankush">Ankush</span> Awadhiya.</p>
    <img src="/images/My_Pic.jpeg" alt="My Pic" title="Image Tag." />
    <a
      href="https://www.bing.com/search?EID=MBHSC&form=BGGCMF&pc=W037&DPC=BG00&q=anchor+tag+in+html"
      >This ia Anchor Tag.</a
    >
    <strong>THis is Strong Tag.</strong>
    <em>This is Emphasis Tag.</em>
